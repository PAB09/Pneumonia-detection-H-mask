Pneumonia Detection in Chest X-ray using AI-driven H-mask Techniques

Project Overview
In this project, I explore the application of parametrized H-mask techniques for the detection of pneumonia in chest X-ray images. The goal is to demonstrate that these H-masks can effectively capture spatially distinguishable features (biomarkers) relevant to pneumonia. The project not only contributes to the enhancement of deep learning models but also transforms them into explainable AI models.

Key Features
Parametrized H-mask Technique: Implementation and demonstration of a parametrized H-mask technique for spatial feature extraction in chest X-ray images.

Pneumonia Detection: Utilization of H-mask to enhance the detection accuracy of pneumonia in chest X-ray images.

Explainable AI Models: The project emphasizes the interpretability of AI models by incorporating parametrized H-masks, providing insights into the features contributing to pneumonia detection.

How it Works
Image Preprocessing:

Chest X-ray images are preprocessed to enhance the quality of input data for the model.
Parametrized H-mask Application:

The parametrized H-mask is applied to chest X-ray images to capture spatial features relevant to pneumonia.
Model Training:

Deep learning models are trained on the preprocessed images, incorporating the information extracted by the parametrized H-mask.
Pneumonia Detection:

The trained models are used for pneumonia detection in chest X-ray images, showcasing improved accuracy.
